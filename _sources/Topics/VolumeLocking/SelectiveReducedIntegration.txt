Deviatoric-volumetric split
---------------------------

Selectively Reduced Integration can be used to cure hourglassing.   The procedure is illustrated most clearly by modifying the formulation for static linear elasticity. To implement the method:
1.      The volume integral in the virtual work principle is separated into a deviatoric and volumetric part by writing
∫RσijδεijdV0=∫R(σijδεij−σkk3δεqq)dV0+∫Rσkk3δεqqdV0

 Here, the first integral on the right hand side vanishes for a hydrostatic stress.
2.      Substituting the linear elastic constitutive equation and the finite element interpolation functions into the virtual work principle, we find that the element stiffness matrix can be reduced to
k(l)aibk=∫V(l)e(Cijkl∂Na(x)∂xj∂Nb(x)∂xl−13Cppkl∂Na(x)∂xi∂Nb(x)∂xl)dV+∫V(l)e13Cppkl∂Na(x)∂xi∂Nb(x)∂xldV

3.      When selectively reduced integration is used, the first volume integral is evaluated using the full integration scheme; the second integral is evaluated using reduced integration points.


Selective reduced integration has been implemented in the sample program fem_selective_reduced_integration.mws.  When this code is run with the input file volumetric_locking_demo.txt it produces the results shown in the figure.  The analytical and finite element solutions agree, and there are no signs of hourglassing.

In many commercial codes, the `fully integrated’ elements actually use selective reduced integration.
