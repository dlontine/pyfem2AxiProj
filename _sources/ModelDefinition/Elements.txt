Element definition
==================

Overview
--------

An element is a mathematical relation that defines how the degrees of
freedom of a node relate to the next. An element definition consists of

-  an element type,

-  an element label, and

-  list of node labels forming the element.

The element type ID is a unique ID defined in ``pyfem``. See :ref:`ElementLibrary` for description of each element type.

Defining elements
-----------------

An element label is a positive integer by which the element is
identified. Element labels do not need to be numbered continuously.
Individual element labels are consistently identified by symbols or .
All external communication uses external element labels.

The node labels forming the element refer to the external node labels.
Node labels must be ordered as required by the element type.

Elements are defined in a two-dimensional list where is a sublist
defining the element label, element type, and external node labels of
nodes forming element . For example, the definition for element in
Figure [fig:nodandel.elem1] is

.. figure:: Element1.png
   :align: center

   Element e

.. code:: python

    elem_e = [e, eletyp_e, i, j]

and the collection of elements is

.. code:: python

    eletab = [elem_1, elem_2, ..., elem_e, ..., elem_M]
