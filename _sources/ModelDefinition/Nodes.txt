Node definition
===============

Overview
--------

A node is a coordinate location in space where degrees of freedom are
defined. A node definition consists of:

-  a node label, and

-  the node coordinates.

Defining nodes
--------------

A node label is a positive integer by which the node is identified. Node
labels are also referred to as external node numbers. Node labels do not
need to be numbered continuous. Individual node labels are consistently
identified by symbols or . All external communication uses external node
labels.

The node coordinates are defined as their position in a regular
Cartesian space. The coordinate system is shown in Figure
[fig:nodandel.coords].

   Node coordinates in Cartesian space.

Nodes are defined in a two-dimensional list where is a sublist defining
the node label and nodal coordinates of the n\ :math:`^{\rm th}` node.
For example, the node definition for node at coordinate location
:math:`P_n` in Figure [fig:nodandel.coords] is

.. code:: python

    node_n = [n, xn, yn, zn]

The collection of nodes is

.. code:: python

    nodtab = [node_1, node_2, ..., node_n, ..., node_N]
