   Python is an open source programming environment that comes standard
   on most operating systems and is becoming ubiqutous in computational
   sciences. However, the version of Python packaged on most operating
   systems does not come with many of the components needed for
   scientific computing (modules such as
   `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`__ and
   `scipy <http://scipy.org/index.html>`__). Building and installing all
   of the necessary components is tedious and error prone. I recommend
   downloading and installing the
   `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ Python distribution
   from `Continuum Analytics <https://continuum.io>`__. All source
   examples were written using Anaconda Python3.5.
