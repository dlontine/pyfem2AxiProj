Introduction
============

Each element in ``pyfem`` has a unique name that identifies the aspects
of the element. The aspects of an element that characterize its behavior
are:

Family
    Elements are broadly classified as lines (trusses or beams), areas
    (2-D or 3-D plates and membranes) or solids (bricks or
    tetrahedrals). With the exception of beam elements, the first letter
    of an element’s name indicates to which family the element belongs.
    For example, is a line element and is an area element. Beam elements
    use as the first letter in the element’s name.

Degrees of freedom
    The degrees of freedom are the fundamental variables calculated
    during the analysis. For a stress/displacement simulation the
    degrees of freedom are the translations and, for beam elements, the
    rotations at each node. For heat transfer the degrees of freedom are
    the temperatures at each node.

Number of nodes
    Degrees of freedom are calculated at the nodes of the element. The
    number of nodes in an element is clearly identified in its name,
    e.g. the one-dimensional 2-node beam element is .

Integration
    ``pyfem`` uses numerical techniques to integrate various quantities
    over the volume of each element, thus allowing complete generality
    in material behavior. ``pyfem`` uses Gaussian quadrature for most
    elements to evaluate the material response at each integration point
    in each element.
